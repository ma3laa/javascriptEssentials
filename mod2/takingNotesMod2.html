    Core Concepts and Syntax:
        - The Structure and Content of JavaScript code
        - Naming and Casing Best Practices
        - Understanding Variables
        - Working with Operators
        - Working with Loops
        - Creating Functions
        - Understanding Types and Objects
    
    Structure and Content:
        - JavaScript is written in plain text just like HTML and CSS but does follow a very specific syntax which developers must learn.
        - JavaScript is not a compiled language but an interpreted language, meaning you write the code and hand it over to the web browser and it takes care of everything.
            - This means no special compiler is necessary.
            - Simple text files and a browser that has JavaScript enabled is all we need.

        - JavaScript is case sensitive (very important)

        example:
            html: <p> Hello! </P> - This works fine
            CSS: Body{Font-SiZe: 1.2em; cOLoR: blue;} - This also works fine
            JS: Alert("Hello World") - Does not work
                alert("Hello World") - Does Work
        
        Everything is case sensitive this includes when working with:
            - Variables
            - Functions
            - Methods
            - Objects
        
        Syntax:
                A set of rules defining the way in which JavaScript programs are constructed
                A computer program is simply a list of instructions to be executed
                    - In JavaScript these are executed by the web broswer
                    - These individual instructions are referred to as statements
                    - Statements are separated by semicolons
                
                Statements are composed of multiple elements:
                    - Values
                    - Operators
                    - Expressions
                    - Keywords
                    - Comments
                
                
        Keywords:
                Var - defines a variable
                For - marks a block of code to be executed so long as the condition is true
                If .. else - marks a block of code to be executed based on a condition
                Return - exits a function
                Break - terminates a switch or a loop
                Function - declares a function
        
        Comments - good for readibility and notes for yourself or other developers, also useful for debugging
            In JS comments are made by using - " // "
            Multiple line comments will use /*these are comments*/
            

    Naming and Casing Best Practice:
        The JavaScript standard states that elements like variables and functions can contain various objects but cannot start with a number
                - Letters
                - Numbers
                - Underscores
                - Dollar signs
                - Valid Names
                    - Var1
                    - My_Variable
                - Invalid Names
                    - 1Variable
                    - 2_variable
        
        Real life JavaaScript programming is very visible and should follow specific naming conventions and rules
        camelCase:
                A typical naming convention that uses capital letters for the first letter in each word
                Helps to join multiple words together without using underscores
                Avoids the use of the (-) character which isn't allowed in many languages 
                Provides the ability to create very descriptive variable names
                    - myVariable()
                    - myFunction()
                    - addNumbers()
                    - modifyBodyElement()
                    - changeCustomerInfo()
        
    
    Understanding Variables:
        
        Variables hold information.
        Spacing + white space doesnt matter.
        // A lot of the content is this part is already known to me so I will not be adding too much.

        Cool example:
                
        var para = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
        console.log(para);

        para.innerHTML = "here is a new value"; //replaces the paragraph tag to that.
    
        
        Sometimes variables will need to contain multiple values simultaneously which is referred to as an array.
        Arrays can be declared in various ways
                Long hand:
                    var multiValues = [];
                    var multiValues = new Array();
                    var multiValues = Array();
                    var multiValues = Array(5);
                
                Short hand:
                    var multiValues [50, 60, "text", 14, "moretext"]
        
        Arrays are simply variables that hold multiple values with no theoretical limit.
        You can request a specific value for sisplay or modification using the index
                multiValues[2] - would call the 3rd item in the array
        
        
        Properties define information about an array such as the Length property
        Methods define executable code and funtionality that belong to the array or object
            - Reverse() - sorts but in reverse
            - Join() - meshes all of the arrays indexes together into one string
            - Sort() - sorts alphanumerically
        
        Length property useful for, for loops


    Working with operators:
        Arithmetic operators:
            + - * / 
                add subtract multiply divide
            %  
                modulus
        
            Increment
                ++
            Decrement
                --

        Assignment operators:
            +=
            -=
            *=
            /=
             =
        Equality operators:
            == (equals)
            === (strictly equals)
            != (not equal)
            !== (not equal value or not equal value type)
        Conditional operaators:
            < (less than)
            <= (^or equal to)
            > (greater than)
            >= (^or equal to)
        
        Ternary operator:
            Uses the syntax (condition)?True:False

            example of how it would be done otherwise:
                var playerOne = 500;
                var playerTwo = 600;

                if (playerOne > playerTwo) {
                    var highscore = playerOne
                } else {
                    var highscore = playerTwo
                }

            example of it being done with ternary operator:
                
                var highscore = (playerOne > playerTwo) ? playerOne : playerTwo;

        For loop:
            var text = "";
        
            for (i = 0; i <; i++){ 
                text+= "The number is " + i + "<br>";
            }
        
        While loop:
            
            var i = 0;
            var text = "";

            while (cars[i]) {
                text+= car[i] + "<br>";
                i++
            }
            console.log(text);

        
        Normally a loop will continue until the condition of the loop no longer evaluates to True, but there are two exceptions using JavaScript keywords:
            - Break
                - A special word that jumps us out of the loop for good
                - Not used as often with For and While loops but you might encounter it
            - Continue 
                - A special word that jumps back to the top of the loop
                - So it stops that particular iteration but not the loop as a whole

        Creating Functions
            - Two basic types of functions exist
                - Anonymous functions
                - Named functions
            
            Both of these are created using the JavaScript keyword "function"

            function myFunction(p1, p2) {
                return p1 * p2;
            }

        
        Function syntax
            Defined by the keyword function followed by a name and () or just ()
            Names can consist of 
                - Letters
                - Numbers
                - Underscores
                - $ signs
            Parameters
                - Names listed in the function definition between the ()
            Arguments
                - Real values received by the function when it is invoked
                - Behave as local variables inside the function
            
            The code inside a function will execute when something invokes (calls) the function
                - An event occurs - a user clicks a button
                - It is invoked or called within JavaScript code
                - Automatically (self-invoked)
            
            The return keyword defines the value that is "returned" back to the caller causing the function to stop

            var x = myFunction(4, 3); // Function is called, return value will end up in x 

            function myFunction(a, b) {
                return a * b;  // function returns the product of a and b
            }

            Best practice is to define the function in the code before the function is called 
                - Functions should be defined early in the JavaScript file
                - Functions are then called later in the file
            
            Functions can be defined globally or nested within other functions

            function square(x) {
                return x * x;
            }

            function length(x, y) {
                function square(x) {
                    return x * x;
                }
            }

         
            
            more example:

                function myFunction(a, b) {
                    return a * b;
                }

                var x = myFunction(4, 3) * 2;
                console.log(x); // will return 24

            
                function myFunction (a,b) {
                    return arguments.length;
                }

                myFunction(3,4); 

                var txt = myFunction.toString();
                console.log(txt);  // returns 2


                function myFunction(x,y) {
                    return x * y
                }

                myFunction(3); // returns NaN (3*undefined = not a number)


                function checkValues(x,y) {
                    if (y === undefined) {
                        y = 0;
                    }
                    return x * y
                }
                checkValues(3); // 3 * 0



                function findMax() {
                    var i;
                    var maax = -Infinity;
                    for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
                        max = arguments[i];
                    }
                    return max;
                }

                x = findMax (1, 123, 500, 115, 44, 88);

            Object:
                var myObject = {
                    firstName:"John",
                    lastName:"Smith",
                    fullName: function() {
                        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
                    }
                }
                myObject.fullNamee();


    Understanding Types and Objects:
        - Most programming languages require you to declare variables using a particular type which tells the programming engine whaat data type to expect.
        - JavaScript is different in that it is a "loosely typed" language and doesn't really care the type of object its dealing with in most cases.
        - Numbers in JavaScript do not have the intricacies that are present in other languages such as decimal, integer, large integer, floating point, etc
        - All numbers in JavaScript are assumed to be floating point integers which could cause a problem
        but since massive numeric calculations aren't usually performed in client-side code its not an issue
        
        var a = 1;
        var b = 12.2;
        var c = 12.324;

        - Numbers in string are considered string (yada yada yada)
        
        Math:

        var x = 200.6
        var y = Math.round(x); // 201

        var a = 200, b = 10000, c = 4;
        var biggest = Math.max(a,b,c);
        var smallest = Math.min(a,b,c);

        var x = 0xFF; // Will print 255, "0x" tells JS that you want the value of a Hexadecimal

        Math.ceil  // Always rounds up
        Math.floor // Always rounds down

        .toString() // turns input into string
        .toExponential() //turns input into exponential

        How to get around double quotes and special characters:
            var y = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

            var x = 'It\'s alright';
            var y = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
        
        
        String properties:
            Length - the primary property that you will use which simply returns the length of the string
        
        String methods:
            charAt() - trying to see where a particular char is
            Match() - find a matching word
            Replace() - replaces a word with another one
            Search()
            Slice() or subString()
            toLowerCase()
            Trim() - trims part off of the string value
            toUpperCase()

        Dates:
            new Date() //uses current date
            new Date(milliseconds) //since 01/01/1970
            yadaayadaa

            var d = new Date("2015-03-31, Mar 31 2015, 121212435353");

            date methods:
                getDate() - day as number
                getDay() - weekday as number
                getFullYear() - four digit year
                getHours() - get the hour
                getMinutes() - get the minutes
                getMonth() - get the month
                getTime() - milliseconds

                var d = new Date();
                console.log(d);
                d.toUTCString();
                d.toDateString();
                
                You can also "setDate"

            
            Example to help understand objects (if you are unsure):
            Objects have properties(attributes) and methods(actions)
                Consider a real life object like pizza
                    All pizza objects have properties
                        Toppings
                        Crust
                        Size
                        etc.
                    They have methods associated with them as well
                        Freeze 
                        Cook 
                        Prepare
            
            
            Nearly everything in JavaScript is an object
                Booleans can be objects
                Numbers can be objects
                Strings can be objects
                Dates are always objects
                Maths are always objects
                Regular expressions are always objects
                Arrays are always objects
                Functions are always objects
                Objects are objects

            Basically everything except for primitive vaalues are objects but even those can be created as objects
            
            Objects are simply variables containing variables
                Variables can only contain a single vaalue
                Objects can contain multiple values in name:value pairs

                var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

                the name:value pairs are referred to as properties
                Methods are actions that can be performed on objects
                    An object property that contains a function definition 

            function person(first, last, age, eye){
                this.firstName = first;
                this.lastName = last;
                this.age = age;
                this.eyeColor = eye;
            }
            var myFather = new person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
            var myMother = new person("Jane", "Doe", 50, "green");
            


            var myFather = new person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");

            for (x in myFather) {
                txt += myFather[x];
            }

            //will print "JohnDoe50blue"

            myFather.nationality = "English"

            // adds English to the end

            delete myFather.personality;

            // removes from the list

            
            Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects
            Essentially methods are properties that contain a function definition
            You create object methods using this syntax
                methodName :function(){executable code}
            You can access the method using this syntax
                objectName.methodName()
            
            Every JavaScript object has a prototype and the prototype is also an object
                New objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype
                Objects created using an object literal or with new Object() inherit from the Object.prototype
                Objects created from a particularobject like new Date() would inherit from the Date prototype

            You can create object prototypes to then use in creating additional objects and you do so using an object constructor function

            You can add properties or methods
                To existing objects
                To all existing objects of a specific type
                To an object prototype

            Adding to objects only changes the object in question but adding to the prototype will modify new objects created using that prototype
