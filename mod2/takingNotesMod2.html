    Module 2 start

    Core Concepts and Syntax:
        - The Structure and Content of JavaScript code
        - Naming and Casing Best Practices
        - Understanding Variables
        - Working with Operators
        - Working with Loops
        - Creating Functions
        - Understanding Types and Objects
    
    Structure and Content:
        - JavaScript is written in plain text just like HTML and CSS but does follow a very specific syntax which developers must learn.
        - JavaScript is not a compiled language but an interpreted language, meaning you write the code and hand it over to the web browser and it takes care of everything.
            - This means no special compiler is necessary.
            - Simple text files and a browser that has JavaScript enabled is all we need.

        - JavaScript is case sensitive (very important)

        example:
            html: <p> Hello! </P> - This works fine
            CSS: Body{Font-SiZe: 1.2em; cOLoR: blue;} - This also works fine
            JS: Alert("Hello World") - Does not work
                alert("Hello World") - Does Work
        
        Everything is case sensitive this includes when working with:
            - Variables
            - Functions
            - Methods
            - Objects
        
        Syntax:
                A set of rules defining the way in which JavaScript programs are constructed
                A computer program is simply a list of instructions to be executed
                    - In JavaScript these are executed by the web broswer
                    - These individual instructions are referred to as statements
                    - Statements are separated by semicolons
                
                Statements are composed of multiple elements:
                    - Values
                    - Operators
                    - Expressions
                    - Keywords
                    - Comments
                
                
        Keywords:
                Var - defines a variable
                For - marks a block of code to be executed so long as the condition is true
                If .. else - marks a block of code to be executed based on a condition
                Return - exits a function
                Break - terminates a switch or a loop
                Function - declares a function
        
        Comments - good for readibility and notes for yourself or other developers, also useful for debugging
            In JS comments are made by using - " // "
            Multiple line comments will use /*these are comments*/
