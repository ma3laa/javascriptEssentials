    Core Concepts and Syntax:
        - The Structure and Content of JavaScript code
        - Naming and Casing Best Practices
        - Understanding Variables
        - Working with Operators
        - Working with Loops
        - Creating Functions
        - Understanding Types and Objects
    
    Structure and Content:
        - JavaScript is written in plain text just like HTML and CSS but does follow a very specific syntax which developers must learn.
        - JavaScript is not a compiled language but an interpreted language, meaning you write the code and hand it over to the web browser and it takes care of everything.
            - This means no special compiler is necessary.
            - Simple text files and a browser that has JavaScript enabled is all we need.

        - JavaScript is case sensitive (very important)

        example:
            html: <p> Hello! </P> - This works fine
            CSS: Body{Font-SiZe: 1.2em; cOLoR: blue;} - This also works fine
            JS: Alert("Hello World") - Does not work
                alert("Hello World") - Does Work
        
        Everything is case sensitive this includes when working with:
            - Variables
            - Functions
            - Methods
            - Objects
        
        Syntax:
                A set of rules defining the way in which JavaScript programs are constructed
                A computer program is simply a list of instructions to be executed
                    - In JavaScript these are executed by the web broswer
                    - These individual instructions are referred to as statements
                    - Statements are separated by semicolons
                
                Statements are composed of multiple elements:
                    - Values
                    - Operators
                    - Expressions
                    - Keywords
                    - Comments
                
                
        Keywords:
                Var - defines a variable
                For - marks a block of code to be executed so long as the condition is true
                If .. else - marks a block of code to be executed based on a condition
                Return - exits a function
                Break - terminates a switch or a loop
                Function - declares a function
        
        Comments - good for readibility and notes for yourself or other developers, also useful for debugging
            In JS comments are made by using - " // "
            Multiple line comments will use /*these are comments*/
            

    Naming and Casing Best Practice:
        The JavaScript standard states that elements like variables and functions can contain various objects but cannot start with a number
                - Letters
                - Numbers
                - Underscores
                - Dollar signs
                - Valid Names
                    - Var1
                    - My_Variable
                - Invalid Names
                    - 1Variable
                    - 2_variable
        
        Real life JavaaScript programming is very visible and should follow specific naming conventions and rules
        camelCase:
                A typical naming convention that uses capital letters for the first letter in each word
                Helps to join multiple words together without using underscores
                Avoids the use of the (-) character which isn't allowed in many languages 
                Provides the ability to create very descriptive variable names
                    - myVariable()
                    - myFunction()
                    - addNumbers()
                    - modifyBodyElement()
                    - changeCustomerInfo()
        
    
    Understanding Variables:
        
        Variables hold information.
        Spacing + white space doesnt matter.
        // A lot of the content is this part is already known to me so I will not be adding too much.

        Cool example:
                
        var para = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
        console.log(para);

        para.innerHTML = "here is a new value"; //replaces the paragraph tag to that.
    
        
        Sometimes variables will need to contain multiple values simultaneously which is referred to as an array.
        Arrays can be declared in various ways
                Long hand:
                    var multiValues = [];
                    var multiValues = new Array();
                    var multiValues = Array();
                    var multiValues = Array(5);
                
                Short hand:
                    var multiValues [50, 60, "text", 14, "moretext"]
        
        Arrays are simply variables that hold multiple values with no theoretical limit.
        You can request a specific value for sisplay or modification using the index
                multiValues[2] - would call the 3rd item in the array
        
        
        Properties define information about an array such as the Length property
        Methods define executable code and funtionality that belong to the array or object
            - Reverse() - sorts but in reverse
            - Join() - meshes all of the arrays indexes together into one string
            - Sort() - sorts alphanumerically
        
        Length property useful for, for loops


    Working with operators:
        Arithmetic operators:
            + - * / 
                add subtract multiply divide
            %  
                modulus
        
            Increment
                ++
            Decrement
                --

        Assignment operators:
            +=
            -=
            *=
            /=
             =
        Equality operators:
            == (equals)
            === (strictly equals)
            != (not equal)
            !== (not equal value or not equal value type)
        Conditional operaators:
            < (less than)
            <= (^or equal to)
            > (greater than)
            >= (^or equal to)
        
        Ternary operator:
            Uses the syntax (condition)?True:False

            example of how it would be done otherwise:
                var playerOne = 500;
                var playerTwo = 600;

                if (playerOne > playerTwo) {
                    var highscore = playerOne
                } else {
                    var highscore = playerTwo
                }

            example of it being done with ternary operator:
                
                var highscore = (playerOne > playerTwo) ? playerOne : playerTwo;

        For loop:
            var text = "";
        
            for (i = 0; i <; i++){ 
                text+= "The number is " + i + "<br>";
            }
        
        While loop:
            
            var i = 0;
            var text = "";

            while (cars[i]) {
                text+= car[i] + "<br>";
                i++
            }
            console.log(text);

        
        Normally a loop will continue until the condition of the loop no longer evaluates to True, but there are two exceptions using JavaScript keywords:
            - Break
                - A special word that jumps us out of the loop for good
                - Not used as often with For and While loops but you might encounter it
            - Continue 
                - A special word that jumps back to the top of the loop
                - So it stops that particular iteration but not the loop as a whole
