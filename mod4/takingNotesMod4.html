    Working with Libraries:

    - Introduction to libraries
    - Using jQuery
    - Modifying Web Pages using jQuery


    A library is a collection of code that can be used to gain additional functionality or just to achieve results more quickly

    Libraries:
    jQuery:
        - Used by many of the largest companies in the world
        - Uses CSS selectors to manipulate DOM objects on the paage
        - Provides a companian UI fraamework and numerous other plug-ins
    Prototype:
        - Provides a simple API to perform common web tasks
        - Enhances JavaScript by providing classes and inheritance
    MooTools
        - A framework offering an API to make common JavaScript programming easier
        - Includes lightweight effects and some animations


    In order to use these libraries you must add them to your page in the <script> tags, either in the <head> or <body> section of the document
        - Src attribute tells where to get the file
        - Added just like any other external script
        - Can be stored locally
        - Can be obtained using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
        
    
    To begin using jQuery you either download it localaly or use a CDN
        Local jQuery files are preferred on production websites for speed and reliability
        CDN is perfect for development, testing and learning
    To use jQuery, put it in <script src="pathing of file"></script>
    

    jQuery Syntax
        The syntax is tailored for selecting HTML elements aand the performing actions on those elements

    $(selector).action()

    $(this).hide() - hides current object
    $("p").hide() - hides paragraphs
    $(".test").hide() - hides class
    $("#test").hide() - hides ID


    A common problem when programming JavaScript has to do with scripts running before the page is loaded which sometimes prevents
    the scripts from gaining access to HTML elements on the page

    jQuery has a function called 'ready()' that is designed to take care of that, as it waits for the pages to be ready (all HTML elements loaded)

    Essentially you would just place the code inside the ready function

    $(document).ready( function () {
        alert("Helo World");
    });
