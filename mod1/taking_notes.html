    Mod 1 Notes:
        Most popular programming language!!
        JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language

        What can JS do for you?
        Modify the HTML content of the page:
            document.getElementById("demo").innerhtml = "Hello JavaScript";
        Change HTML attributes:
            var image = document.getElementById("myImage");
            image src = "images/newimg.jpg";
        Change HTML styles through CSS:
            document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";
        Validate data input into forms

        Some practical examples:
            Moving the world in google maps
            Autopopulating form fields
            Checking the format of an email aaddress or phone number
            Moving HTML elements across the screen
            Change an element to display different customer reviews every few seconds
            and more...

        
        In JavaScript operators are:

        AND &&
        OR  ||
        NOT !
