    Mod 1 Notes:
        Most popular programming language!!
        JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language

        What can JS do for you?
        Modify the HTML content of the page:
            document.getElementById("demo").innerhtml = "Hello JavaScript";
        Change HTML attributes:
            var image = document.getElementById("myImage");
            image src = "images/newimg.jpg";
        Change HTML styles through CSS:
            document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";
        Validate data input into forms

        Some practical examples:
            Moving the world in google maps
            Autopopulating form fields
            Checking the format of an email aaddress or phone number
            Moving HTML elements across the screen
            Change an element to display different customer reviews every few seconds
            and more...

        
        In JavaScript operators are:

        AND &&
        OR  ||
        NOT !
    
        JavaScript does not have any build-in print or display functions but there are various ways that it caan "display" information
        Realise that these display options are often for developers anad not end users:
            Writing an alert box
            Writing HTML output
            Writing to an HTML element
            Writing into the browser console


            <script>
                window.alert(5+6);
            </script>
            - An annoying way of getting information

            <script>
                document.write(5+6);
            </script>
            - Only for testing
            - If done after page is loaded it elminates all HTML
