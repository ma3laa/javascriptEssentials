    MODULE 3 - GETTING A HANDLE ON THE DOM

    Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)
    Accessing DOM elements
    Changing DOM elements
    Creating DOM elements
    Responding to Events on the page



    Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM):

    The JavaScript code that we write does not operate in vacuum but attached to HTML web pages
    The web page is the script upon which we are working so we must be able to reach into the page to get information and have the page respond back to our code
    Understanding the DOM is the way to do that, it is an incredibly important part of understanding the functionality of JavaScript

    What is the DOM?
    Its not a language
    Its not a part of JavaScript
    Its a fairly vague term

    Web definition: "The Document Object Model is an application programming interface that defines logical structure of well formed an XML and HTML documents"

    Document - is the web page itself
    Object - refers to the objects that are created based on the HTML structure
    Model - a consistent way to approach the various objects


    Accessing DOM elements:

    There are multiple ways of finding and accessing DOM elements which is the first step to dealing with the HTML DOM
    If you want to manipulate the HTML elements you must first locate them
    The key is understanding "where" in the DOM is the item that you wish to grab hold of as well as the critical question "Is it unique?"

    Options:
        document.getElementById
        document.getElementByTagName
        document.getElementByClassName
        document.querySelectorAll - CSS selectors


    Example of modifying title on a webpage

    document.getElementById("mainTitle").innerHTML = "Hello World!"

    This will change the mainTitle content associated id to "Hello World!"
    

    Once you have the element you can access individual attributes using the getAttribute() method
    This method will allow you to access the attributes for any element on the page

    myElement.getAttribute("align");

    
    document.getElementById("Malaysia").getAttribute("src");
    //finds the id content and grabs the source location
    // ^^method to find it on the page, ^^method to access a property (src)

    

    Changing DOM elements:

    Accessing DOM elements is the first step but often we would ike to modify these eements either entirely or in part, such as attributes
    One such way of changingelements is to modify the content which is performed using the innerHTML property
    Another option is to modify attributes
    
    myElement.setAttribute("align", "left");
    //                      name     value
    // name = what you want to modify
    // value = what you want to modify it to


    Another way in which the HTML can be changed is to actuallly modify the style that is used using CSS properties

    Any CSS styles can be modified on page load or based on events on the page
        The key is to use the CSS property names with the (-) character
            Font-family becomes fontFamily
            Border-style becomes borderStyle
            Background-color becomes backgroundColor
        Using setAttribute("style","color:blue"); would also be supported and can use the (-)

        <script>
            document.getElementById("p2").style.color = "blue";
        </script>

        // p2 text now becomes blue

        
    Creating DOM elements:

    Although the innerHTML property can be used to add content to a page its not the cleanest method available with plenty of chance for error
    
    Instead you can create elements within the DOM and once created add a text node to those elements
    
    This results in a more precise and better way of modifying page content which always involves two steps
        Create the element
        Add the element to the right place in the document

    
    var newElement = document.createElement("li");
    myElement.appendchild(newElement);

    The next step is either
        Access the innerHTML property of the element we just created to add content
        Create a new text node and attach to the element(more precise)

    var myText = document.createTextNode("new list item text");
    newElement.appendchild(myText);
    
    
    Example:
        (This does make sense) (In the example there is a li id called books)

        var myListItem = document.createElement("li");
        var myTextNode = document.createTextNode("The Hobbit");
        myListItem.appendChild(myTextNode);

        var books = document.getElementById("books");
        books.appendChild(myListItem);

        // This piece of code added "The Hobbit" to the list 

        Using "myElement.insertBefore()" allows you to insert the child




    Responding to Events:

    JavaScript is supposed to control the behaviour of the page and its interactivity with the user which means that our code should be able to respond to actions that are taken on the page

    This is where events and event listeners come into play
       - You don't cause the events they are occurring all the time
       - You choose which of these events that you want to respond to
       - You write an event listener in order to handle those particular events and respond the way that you would like
    
    Three ways to react to events:
        Write the JavaScript code directly into the HTML
        Specify the element and event you want tot handle and write a function
        Use the addEventListener() function


    
    The first option is a simple option and is often done but really not recommended
        It mixes the HTML code and the JavaScript
        Its not very portable
        Generally not a good idea

    <button onclick='alert("Hello world!");'>Run some JavaScript</button>


    The second option is often the best and involves identifying the element you want to act upon and the event that you would like to respond to
        The element is referenced by using a variable
        The event is chosen from the list of possible events
        An anonymous function is created that contains the code that you want to run
    
    myElement.onclick = function() {
        //Code goes here
    };


    The third option uses the "addEventListener()" method
    Parameters
        The event you want to respond to minus the word on
        The function that you want to call
        True or False

    document.addEventListener('click', myFunction, False);


    There are many events that you can respond to:
        Onclick
        Onload
        Onunload
        Onchange
        Onmouseover
        Onmouseout
        Onmouseup - When not clicking down
        Onmousedown - When clicking down
        Onfocus
        onblur

<!doctype HTML>
<html>
    <body>

        <div onmouseover="mOver(this)" onmouseout="mOut(this)" style="background-color:blue;width:120px;height:20px;padding:40px;">Mouse over me</div>

        <script> 
            function mOver(obj) {
                obj.innerHTML = "Thank you"
            }

            function mOut(obj) {
                obj.innerHTML = "Mouse over me"
            }
        </script>

        
        
        
        


    </body>
</html>

<!-- 

    There are times when we would like to behaviour on a page automatically controlled based on a time lapse
    Though not technically events they are very similar in their function
    Two built in functions will provide this capability quite easily in JavaScript
        setTimeout()
        setInterval()

    setTimeout(myFunction, 5000) // setTimeout interval is in milliseconds

    setInterval(changeImage, 5000) //also in milliseconds
