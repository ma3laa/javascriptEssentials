    Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)
    Accessing DOM elements
    Changing DOM elements
    Creating DOM elements
    Responding to Events on the page



    Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM):

    The JavaScript code that we write does not operate in vacuum but attached to HTML web pages
    The web page is the script upon which we are working so we must be able to reach into the page to get information and have the page respond back to our code
    Understanding the DOM is the way to do that, it is an incredibly important part of understanding the functionality of JavaScript

    What is the DOM?
    Its not a language
    Its not a part of JavaScript
    Its a fairly vague term

    Web definition: "The Document Object Model is an application programming interface that defines logical structure of well formed an XML and HTML documents"

    Document - is the web page itself
    Object - refers to the objects that are created based on the HTML structure
    Model - a consistent way to approach the various objects


    Accessing DOM elements:

    There are multiple ways of finding and accessing DOM elements which is the first step to dealing with the HTML DOM
    If you want to manipulate the HTML elements you must first locate them
    The key is understanding "where" in the DOM is the item that you wish to grab hold of as well as the critical question "Is it unique?"

    Options:
        document.getElementById
        document.getElementByTagName
        document.getElementByClassName
        document.querySelectorAll - CSS selectors


    Example of modifying title on a webpage

    document.getElementById("mainTitle").innerHTML = "Hello World!"

    This will change the mainTitle content associated id to "Hello World!"
    

    Once you have the element you can access individual attributes using the getAttribute() method
    This method will allow you to access the attributes for any element on the page

    myElement.getAttribute("align");

    
    document.getElementById("Malaysia").getAttribute("src");
    //finds the id content and grabs the source location
    // ^^method to find it on the page, ^^method to access a property (src)
